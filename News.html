    Rockstar Games has officially announced that Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) will now release on May 26, 2026, pushing back the anticipated launch from its previously expected fall 2025 window. The company cited the need for additional development time to ensure the game meets the high standards expected by fans.

“We are very sorry that this is later than you expected,” Rockstar stated. “The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.” </div>
