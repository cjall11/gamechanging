			<center><h3> Cyberpunk Review</h3></center>
		 Cyberpunk 2077 is a story of redemption in the truest sense. At launch, it was a chaotic mess—ambitious but broken, dripping with potential yet crushed under the weight of unmet promises. But beneath the bugs and performance issues was a game with real heart, an immersive vision of the future where style clashed with despair on every neon-lit street corner. CD Projekt Red didn’t abandon that vision. Over time, through relentless updates and the stellar Phantom Liberty expansion, they reshaped Night City into the living, breathing dystopia we were promised. Now, it’s a place where every alley has a secret, every quest has weight, and your choices carve deep scars into the story.

Today, Cyberpunk 2077 is more than just a cautionary tale—it’s a triumph. The writing is sharp and emotional, the characters unforgettable, and the revamped gameplay finally feels worthy of the world it inhabits. Whether you’re hacking through networks or sliding through firefights with chromed-out reflexes, the game rewards creativity and personalization. It still carries some of its imperfections, but that almost feels fitting. In a genre that’s about broken people in a broken world clinging to freedom, Cyberpunk 2077 has become the very thing it tried to be all along: a flawed masterpiece with a soul worth fighting for.

	Oh boy, Overwatch. I love this game—I want to love it—but man, Blizzard makes it really hard sometimes. This isn't just a rant, it’s a love letter dipped in frustration.

First off, let’s talk about Overwatch 2. They hyped it up like it was going to revolutionize everything: a PvE mode that was supposed to redefine the franchise, new storytelling, character development, skill trees—heck, they made it sound like we were getting Overwatch meets Mass Effect. And then? They scrapped most of it. Just quietly tucked it under the rug and acted like we wouldn’t notice. We were sold a dream, and then handed a glorified patch with a new title screen.

And don’t even get me started on the monetization. Overwatch 1 used to reward you for playing. You’d grind for skins, sure, but it felt fair. Now? Battle passes, overpriced skins, bundles that cost as much as actual full games. It’s wild. A $20 skin? For one character? That I can’t even see during gameplay unless I emote in front of a mirror? Come on. It's like they took the heart of the game and stuck a price tag on every artery.
		The matchmaking? Broken. I’ve had games where half my team is clearly new and the enemy team is a bunch of demigods with golden weapons and 10,000 hours logged. I play support because I love it, but I’m tired of being flamed because someone ran into the enemy spawn and expected me to heal through divine intervention. And don’t even try solo queueing—unless you enjoy existential despair.

But the worst part? I still play. I log in, I hope it’s going to be a good match. I love these characters. I love the potential this game has. The voice lines, the maps, the lore that’s drip-fed through tweets and seasonal events—it’s all so good, or at least it could be. Blizzard has lightning in a bottle, and they keep shaking it like a soda and tossing it in the microwave.

I’m not mad because I hate Overwatch. I’m mad because I used to adore it—and I still see what it could be if someone just gave a damn. Stop chasing whales, Blizzard. Start chasing legacy.
